### Project Plan - Animating Sand as a Fluid

*Physically-Based Simulation in Computer Graphics HS21*

*Team: Yifan Yu, Bo Li, Yitian Ma*

##### Category

Fluids - Standard solver - FLIP solver, sand

##### Method

PIC/FLIP with modification to simulate sand as described in paper "Animating Sand as a Fluid" (*Yongning Zhu and Robert Bridson. 2005. Animating sand as a fluid.* *ACM Trans. Graph.* *24, 3 (July 2005), 965â€“972.* https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rbridson/docs/zhu-siggraph05-sandfluid.pdf)

##### Minimal Target

Successfully implement PIC & FLIP methods to animate sand in a simple scene.

##### Desired Target

Successfully implement PIC, FLIP, and one extra PIC-based (RPIC/APIC/PolyPIC) method to animate sand. Also implement their normal version for fluid simulation to show comparison in more complex scenes.

##### Timeline

**By milestone:** Correct implementation of PIC & FLIP to animate sand, can show demo in a simple scene.

**By final presentation:** Correct implementation of PIC, FLIP, and one PIC-based method to animate sand and normal fluid (water), can show demo in more complex scenes. Each team member will mainly implemente one of those methods.
